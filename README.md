# Pirate Intelligent Agent for Treasure Hunt Game

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem. The goal of the agent is to find the treasure before a human player does. The environment for the agent is represented by a maze, and the agent learns to navigate through the maze to reach the treasure.

### Code Details

**Given Code:**
- **TreasureMaze.py:** This file defines the environment and the maze structure, representing the maze as a matrix.
- **GameExperience.py:** This file is responsible for storing the episodes of the game experience, including the states, actions, and rewards encountered by the pirate agent.
- **TreasureHuntGame.ipynb:** A Jupyter Notebook containing the starter code for the Q-learning implementation.

**My Contributions:**
- **Deep Q-Learning Algorithm:** I completed the sections of the Jupyter Notebook where the Q-learning algorithm is implemented. This involved coding the Q-training process to enable the pirate agent to learn from its experiences and improve its pathfinding over time.
- **Code Refinements:** I ensured that the code runs without errors and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

## Connection to Computer Science

### The Role of Computer Scientists

Computer scientists play a crucial role in designing and implementing systems that solve complex problems, such as creating intelligent agents for games, optimizing algorithms, and ensuring systems are reliable and efficient. Their work matters because it drives innovation, enhances user experiences, and can be applied to a wide range of industries, from gaming to healthcare.

### Problem-Solving Approach

As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically by first understanding the problem space, breaking it down into smaller, manageable components, and then applying the appropriate algorithms or techniques to solve it. In this project, I applied reinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep Q-learning, to enable the pirate agent to learn and improve its performance over time.

### Ethical Responsibilities

My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the solutions I develop are reliable, fair, and do not cause harm to the end users or the organization. This means considering the implications of the algorithms I choose and ensuring that they are tested thoroughly to avoid unintended consequences, such as biased decision-making or security vulnerabilities.
